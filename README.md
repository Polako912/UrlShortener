# UrlShortener
Simple app with UI to shorten long urls.

## How to start?
Make sure that file `ShortenedUrl.db` has the same path as in `appsettings.json`, otherwise you will not be able to connect to database. The same goes with localhost ports for both API and Angular App.

## Key assumptions
Use lightweight databse and make sure that short link will be redirectiong to correct url. Make code easy to understand, clean and testable.

## Future ideas
Work on UI/UX side, make it more user appealing. Use external provider for logging ie. Microsoft Azure AppInsight.
